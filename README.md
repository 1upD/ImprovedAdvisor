ImprovedAdvisor

Npc Advisor with fixes and improvements

Changes made to the vanilla code:
-New custom model: Removed tongue so it doesn't appear at their back when recieving damage, has a phymodel (so it has a ragdoll) and two new melee animations made by me (10/10 quality).
-Advisor now follows your movement, not longer floats looking on the same direction set at the map.
-Added a melee attack, so you can't approach him to avoid the props.
-The PinPoint feature, that was disabled, has been reenabled, fixed, and made it pretty (added a beam so it makes clear that is he that is moving you).
-Added some extra Inputs to control the npc.
-Replaced sounds that are no found for others.
-Various fixes/improvements of minor detail.

Just credit Valve and me (Maestro FÃ©nix) if you are going to use it on your mod.
